# BAS475-Stocks-Project
Project created by Students of the University of Tennessee's Business Analytics Department: Tina Le, Justin Hairston, Carter Spence, and Kelton Rivas

This Shiny app was created within R-Studio. This app is designed to allow the user to view stocks of publicly traded companies. The features of this app include: 
1) A modified plot of the selected stock, which allows the user to view the price of the selected stock. All stock data is sourced from Yahoo.
2) A candle stick plot which is color coded to be either red or green. If the stock was green on the selected day, then it closed at an overall higher price. If it was red, then it closed at a lower overall price. All data is sourced from Yahoo.
3) A Ticker look up so that the user may learn the symbol associated with a publicly traded company. GM for General Motors, AAPL for Apple, etc.
4) A standard graph of the closing price of the selected stock listed on the S&P 500 with data sourced from Yahoo.
5) All plots found within this application give the user the ability to select a range of dates for their chosen stock.

We hope that this tool is useful for anyone trying to research stocks and would love feedback.
